    	<p class="paragraph">
    	MoGeo (short for M&oacute;nika's Geometry) is a Java (desktop) application designed for helping kids familiarize with 2D Geometry.
    	The application will allow drawing various 2D shapes (line, triangle, rectangle, circle...), calculate various things (length, area...),
    	perform various checks (are two lines parallel? does the triangle have a 90 degree angle?), etc.    
    	</p>
    	<p class="paragraph">
    	Current status of this project is <b>just started</b>. This means we have no demo version yet, no screenshot available. 
    	</p>
    	<h2>Q & A</h2>
    	<dl>
    		<dt>When do you expect to complete the application?</dt>
    		<dd>We hope we can add more and more features in time, maybe extend it to 3D Geometry so we really hope this will be an ongoing development and never be "done".</dd>
    		<dt>When do you expect to have a first usable version?</dt>
    		<dd>It's very difficult to say anything about that. We're hoping that a first version will be released during 2016 but don't take this as a promise. Our goal is to deliver a nice, easy to use application not to publish something that is hard to use or doesn't work.</dd>
    		<dt>How much will it cost?</dt>
    		<dd>There is no price set. And it will never be... All projects developed by PFA Alliance are free.</dd>
    		<dt>What operating systems will be supported?</dt>
    		<dd>Application will be written in Java 8. Any operating system that will support Java 8 will allow the application to run. This means: Windows, MacOS, Linux / Unix and a lot more.</dd>
    		<dt>Will there be an Andriod or iOS version?</dt>
    		<dd><i>Never say never...</i> so we're not going to do say that. But our focus is now on Java...</dd>
